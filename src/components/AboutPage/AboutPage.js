                I am a proactive, teachable, detail-oriented, and self-motivated
                individual with a flair for learning and re-learning who loves
                to give my best on any task I am assigned to, as quality for me
                is paramount. I hold a masterâ€™s degree{' '}
                <span style={{ color: '#42f55d' }}>(distinction)</span> in
                Electrical and Computer Engineering from the University of
                Waterloo, Ontario, Canada where I took courses pertaining to
                Software Engineering, Data Analysis, Image Processing, Control
                Engineering and Business.
              </p>
              <p>
                Upon completion of my degree, I took a delve into Web
                Development in a bid to make responsive, scalable, and
                user-friendly interfaces. So far, I have learnt how to design
                algorithms with the use of adequate data structures to reduce
                the downtime posed by information access and retrieval, CRUD
                operations, work with relational and non-relational databases,
                HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React JS, Redux, Express JS, Node JS,
                etc.
              </p>
              <p>
                I design and build RESTful APIs for web services and also
                consume them to make responsive websites. Also, I am conversant
                with machine learning algorithms and have worked on both object
                classification and detection tasks.{' '}

                I am currently seeking a full-time position at a value adding
                organization where I could leverage my skills to help in the
                problem-solving process while also developing myself and gaining
                new experiences from the organization. Learning for me never
                ends, as a product and quality oriented individual, I would sure
                put forth my best to deliver excellent performing results and
                nothing short.
